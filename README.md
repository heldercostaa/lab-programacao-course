## About
The intention of this course is to practice implementations (in C/C++) of some algorithms that we've seen a lot of the theory through computer science graduation. The complete program and some extra information about the course can be seen in [this page](http://dc.ufc.br/~pablo/2019-1/lp/) (in Portuguese).  

This repository is divided into folders related to every class and its corresponding implementation and, **for each main assignment, a separated folder**. It's possible that some folders may not contain any implementation because this class was probably just about the theory and explanation.  

Thus, each class has pictures of the board (in Portuguese) with the Professor's annotations.  

## Implementations
The following implementations were built through the course:  

### Quicksort and variations [[_link_](https://github.com/heldercostaa/lab-programacao-course/tree/master/quicksort)]
The focus of these implementations is to check the impact of the different ways to implement **Quicksort** algorithm, the **pivot selection**, and the **partition**.  

> For the **quicksort**, variations are built: 
- A recursive implementation with indexes.
- A recursive implementation with pointers.
- An optimized implementation with the recursion on the smaller side of the array.  
> For the **pivot selection** are implemented four strategies: 
- Fixed (the first) index of the array.
- Random element on the array.
- Hoare algorithm.
- BFPRT algorithm.  
> And about the **partitions**: 
- One pivot (2 partitions).
- Dual pivot (3 partitions).  

After passing some input about the array to sort, for each combination of these above implementations, a quicksort is built to sort the array and, at the end, the time of **all combinations** is compared in a table.
